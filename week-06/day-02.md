# Day 02

## Agenda

- Warm-up: Click count!
- Bank jQuery refactor code along
- Project 00 Code & Tell

## Exercise: Click count

Using HTML and JavaScript + jQuery create a website that tells the user how many times a button has been clicked:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<body>
<p>You have clicked the button <span>0</span> time(s).</p>
<button>Click me!</button>
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.0.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

## Bank jQuery refactor code along

Let's refactor the Bank assignment into jQuery!

## Project 00 Code & Tell

The goal is to give each other a chance to step back and take a more holistic view of the code and the engineering 
efforts of the this first assignment. At the end of the session, we should have a few chores to improve those areas 
we are not so proud of.

- pair up: http://parrit.cfapps.io/seifx-sydney-seifx01
- code review each other's work
- show to your pair 
    - a piece of code you are proud of
    - a piece of code you would like to improve
- write down action items of the areas you are not so proud of, and improve them!
- send your report (txt file would do it) to Aaron and myself via Slack
